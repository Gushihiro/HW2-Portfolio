## My Portfolio

Created a portfolio with soft colors and simple design to emphasize what I've learned from the first week of the UW Coding Bootcamp. I've established a solid framework to continue to build off of and apply new projects to as I complete them throughout the bootcamp.

I've left some lorem ipsum in the portfolio as placeholders for preview locations, eventually being filled by pictures of future projects.
